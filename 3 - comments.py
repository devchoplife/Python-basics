# THis is a comment 
print("Hello, World!!!")

print("Hello, World!!!") # This is a comment

# Multiline comments
"""
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add 
a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
"""
print("Hello, World!!!")
